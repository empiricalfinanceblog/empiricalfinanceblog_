An often underestimated problem in the data science community is the choice of the performance index to assess the goodness of a machine learning algorithm. In this post I will discuss pro’s and con’s of the main performance indices used to evaluate a binary classifier (footnote: same results holds for multi-class classifiers). Then I will discuss about an overlooked (according to the author of this post) performance index known in the literature as Matthews correlation and its connection with well-known performance indices.
